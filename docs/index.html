<h1 class="genres"><b><i> Various Electronic Music Genres</i></b></h1>

<P class="genres"> EDM (Electronic Dance Music) is an umbrella term that refers to a wide variety of similar (but not identical) music genres. 
The music almost always has a repetitive percussion track and typically includes a melody played by a synthesizer laid over the drumming.
It is initially originated from disco.However,after 1980s,more and more synthesizers and drum tracks came into play, eventually becoming the various genres of EDM we know today.</P>

<span class="one">
<h1 class="two"><b><i>1.House</i></b></h1>


<p>House music was the first form of electronic music as we know it today, and to many it is still the best. Formulated in the black neighbourhoods of Chicago in the 1980s, house music sprung up from the ashes of disco, and was pioneered by young musicians who bought Roland TR-808s and other drum machines at pawn shops.</p>

<p>House has remained popular ever since, with DJs from the genre’s heyday still playing festivals and selling out shows around the world, and classic tracks continuing to set dancefloors alight. Many of the world’s “superstar DJs” play a pop-infused form of house, and the genre has influenced everything from R&B and hip-hop to pop.</p>

<span class="two">	
<h1 class="three"><b><i>2.Trance</i></b></h1>

<P>Trance music is characterized by a tempo lying between 135–150 bpm (BPM), repeating melodic phrases and a musical form that distinctly builds tension and elements throughout a track often culminating in 1 to 2 "peaks" or "drops". Although trance is a genre of its own, it liberally incorporates influences from other musical styles such as techno, house,pop, chill-out, classical music, tech house, ambient and film music.</P>

<P>A trance is a state of hypnotism and heightened consciousness. This is portrayed in trance music by the mixing of layers with distinctly foreshadowed build-up and release. A common characteristic of trance music is a mid-song climax followed by a soft breakdown disposing of beats and percussion entirely,leaving the melody or atmospherics to stand alone for an extended period before gradually building up again. Trance tracks are often lengthy to allow for such progression and commonly have sufficiently sparse opening and closing sections to facilitate mixing by DJs.</P>

<P>Trance is mostly instrumental, although vocals can be mixed in: typically they are performed by mezzo-soprano to soprano female soloists, often without a traditional verse/chorus structure. Structured vocal form in trance music forms the basis of the vocal trance subgenre, which has been described as "grand, soaring, and operatic" and "ethereal female leads floating amongst the synths". However, male singers, such as Jonathan Mendelsohn, are also featured.</P>

<h1 class="four"><b><i>3.Hip Hop </i></b></h1>
<span class="three">
<p>Hip hop is a popular music genre consistent of rapping, breakbeats created with drum machines, bass, and in its most common forms, synthesizer effects. Electronic subgenres include Dirty South, crunk, electro rap, trip hop, acid rap, bounce and hip house. Hip hop, however, is highly versatile and is often mixed with R&B, funk, soul, jazz, pop, rock and metal.</p>

<p>While hip hop was created by African Americans and Latinos, Jamaican Kool DJ Herc made a major contribution to hip hop by introducing elements of reggae and dub, prominently toasting. Hip hop was originally novelty music, with lyrics rarely meaningful, including a rap variant of the Gilligan's Island theme song. </p>
